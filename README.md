# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project-Excel-Dataset-Python

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project performed on an Excel dataset using Python’s primary data analysis and visualization libraries.

### 📌 Project Objective

To clean, explore, and visualize the dataset in order to uncover patterns, relationships, trends, and anomalies that can support data-driven decision making.

### 🧠 Libraries Used

* **NumPy** — numerical operations and array handling
* **Pandas** — data loading, cleaning, transformation, and analysis
* **Matplotlib** — basic plotting and charting
* **Seaborn** — statistical data visualization

### 🔍 Analysis Performed

* Data inspection and summary statistics
* Handling missing values and duplicates
* Data type corrections and preprocessing
* Univariate and bivariate analysis
* Correlation analysis
* Outlier detection
* Visual exploration through multiple plots

### 📈 Visualizations

* Histograms and distribution plots
* Bar charts and count plots
* Box plots
* Correlation heatmap
* Pair plots

### 🛠️ Tools & Environment

Python • Jupyter Notebook • Excel
